# Überwort: German - English Dictionary

## A German Pop-Up Dictionary and Learning Tool

This browser extension allows you to translate German words
by simply hovering over them with the mouse.

## Highlights

- Can be turned on and off with a single mouse-click.
- Highlights the characters whose translation is displayed in the pop-up
  window.

## How Does It Work?

Once Überwort is installed on your computer you'll see a little icon showing
the Überwort logo near the upper right-hand corner of your browser. By
clicking on this icon you can turn the extension on and off. Click on it and
wait until you see the word "On" displayed in red and white on top of the icon.
This tells you that the dictionary is active. If you want to turn it off again,
just click on the icon again and the red "On" label disappears. So with a
single mouse-click you can activate or deactivate the dictionary.

Once Überwort has been turned on, showing the red "On" label on the icon, you
can go to a web page in German and point your mouse at some German words.
A pop-up window opens up automatically showing you the translation of the word
you were pointing at.

## What Information Does It Show?

By default, the pop-up window shows the following pieces of information:

- The German words you're pointing at with your mouse.
- The English translation. Sometimes, Überwort finds more than one matching
  entry in its dictionary. In this case it shows you all of the matching
  entries.

## Keyboard Navigation

Sometimes the pop-up window is hiding the text you're looking at. You can move
it out of the way using <kbd>X</kbd> and <kbd>Y</kbd> on the keyboard (this
moves the pop-up window up or down), or hit <kbd>A</kbd> once or twice to move
it to an altogether different location.

## Context Menu Items

When Überwort is enabled, you can right-click on a page to open the browser's
context menu. There will be a menu item for Überwort which you can use to access
a new tab showing a helpful summary of all the keyboard shortcuts. Another
menu item can be used for opening the word list as an alternative to the
<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd> keyboard shortcut.

## What Built-In Dictionary Does It Use?

Überwort comes from the Wiktionary German-English dictionary, available through a data dump that is then parsed and cleaned by [Kaikki](https://kaikki.org/). The JSONL data from Kaikki is then further cleaned and indexed by me.

## Support for Online Dictionaries

Sometimes, in addition to looking at the translation in the pop-up window, you might
want to look up a word in one of the freely available online dictionaries. Überwort
lets you quickly do that by some simple keyboard shortcuts.

- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd> looks up the selected word using [LINE Dict](https://dict.naver.com/linedict/zhendict).
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd> lets you look up the pronunciation on [Forvo](https://forvo.com).
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd> takes you to [Dict.cc](https://dict.cc).
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd> looks up the word in the [Cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/).
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>5</kbd> uses [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/).
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>6</kbd> takes you to [Reverso](https://reverso.net).
- <kbd>T</kbd> is for looking up example sentences at [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org).

Your browser will open a new tab and the word that was shown in the pop-up window
will be looked up in the corresponding online dictionary listed above.

## More Options

Überwort also has an options page which allows you to configure certain aspects
of its behavior. In order to get there just right-click on the Überwort logo
in the upper right-hand corner of the browser and choose "Options". A new tab
will open showing you all the available options with a brief explanation of
each one.
